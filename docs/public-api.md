# mdflow public API reference

This document defines the stable user-facing API for `mdflow` CLI usage.

## CLI command contract

Run `mdflow` or `md` with one of these forms:

```bash
md <agent.md> [flags...]
md <subcommand> [options...]
md.<command> "prompt" [flags...]   # ad-hoc, no file required
```

Supported subcommands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `md init [--engine <e>] [--yes]` | Initialize a flow roster for the current project. Default: launches an installed agent CLI interactively, pre-loaded with the bundled setup guide (uses your engine session; asks for consent first). `--yes` (or no TTY) scaffolds the starter catalog deterministically — zero engine invocations. |
| `md create [name]` | Create a new agent file. |
| `md explain <agent.md>` | Print resolved config and prompt without execution. |
| `md eval <flow.md> [--plan] [--yes] [--filter <text>] [--json]` | Preview or run the flow's executable colocated eval suite (`<flow>.eval.ts`). Cost includes repetitions and is printed before consent. |
| `md feedback <flow.md> "<message>"` | Record durable, private evidence with a stable ID (free). `list`, `show`, `distill`, `dismiss`, `reopen`, and explicit permanent `forget` manage its lifecycle/privacy. |
| `md complain ...` | Compatibility alias for `md feedback`. |
| `md evolve plan\|status\|propose <flow.md> [--yes] [--engine <e>] [--json\|--events]` | Plan for free or create a private, capability-checked, off-path proposal. Source remains unchanged. |
| `md evolve show\|review\|apply\|reject\|retry\|rollback <run-id>` | Inspect the receipt/diff, make an explicit decision, retry, or perform hash-guarded apply/rollback. |
| `md evolve history [flow.md]` | List durable evolution runs. |
| `md evolve prune [--days <n>] [--yes]` | Remove old unapplied private runs and completed job logs; retain applied rollback lineage. |
| `md evolve prune [--days <n>] [--yes]` | Delete eligible old private proposal/job data while retaining applied lineage. |
| `md install <url\|gh:org/repo/path@ref>` | Install a flow from a URL or GitHub shorthand into the registry (project scope by default; `--global` for user scope). Writes `.mdflow/mdflow.lock.json`. |
| `md remove <name>` | Remove an installed registry flow. |
| `md list [--project\|--global]` | List installed registry flows. |
| `md setup` | Configure shell integration. |
| `md logs` | Show log directory and per-agent logs. |
| `md help` | Print CLI help. |

Flows can set `evolve.mode` to `off`, `observe`, `suggest`, `propose`, or the reserved `apply` tier. `propose` prints a content-current plan and queues private background work after explicit actionable feedback; it never applies source. Legacy `evolve: auto` maps to `propose`. Quick reruns are low-confidence observations only. See [`evolve.md`](evolve.md) for the full policy, evidence state machine, receipts, and security boundary.

Eval suites export a statically resolvable default array (directly or through a
top-level `const`). This lets `--plan` derive names, evidence links,
repetitions, quorum, and cost without importing executable suite code. After
consent, runtime shape must match the announced static plan before any flow
invocation starts.

## mdflow-reserved flags

These flags are consumed by mdflow and are not passed to underlying LLM CLIs.

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--engine` | Select the engine explicitly (top rung of the resolution ladder). Deprecated aliases: `--_command`, `-_c`, `--tool`. |
| `--_dry-run` | Print the command plan and prompt without running the engine, inline `!command` imports, or executable code fences. File/URL/context imports are still resolved. |
| `--_edit` | Open resolved prompt in `$EDITOR` before execution. |
| `--_trust` | Skip TOFU trust prompt for remote URLs. |
| `--_no-cache` | Bypass remote URL cache. |
| `--_context` | Print context tree and exit. |
| `--_quiet` | Skip preflight context dashboard. |
| `--_no-menu` | Disable post-run action menu. |
| `--no-evolve`, `--_no-evolve` | Disable post-run evolution observation/proposal handling for this invocation. `MDFLOW_EVOLVE=off` is the environment equivalent. |
| `--raw` | Emit raw markdown output (no terminal renderer). |
| `--json` | Emit a single JSON result object (`{exitCode, command, args, stdout, stderr}`) and disable interactive UI. |

Interactive mode controls are also supported:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--_interactive`, `-_i` | Force interactive mode for supported adapters. |

## Engine resolution

The engine that runs a flow is resolved by a ladder, most explicit first:

1. `--engine` CLI flag (deprecated aliases: `--_command`/`-_c`, `--tool`).
2. `MDFLOW_ENGINE` environment variable.
3. Filename suffix (`task.claude.md`). The segment only wins when it names a
   registered adapter or a binary on `PATH`; otherwise it falls through with a
   `Warning [ENGINE_NOT_FOUND]`.
4. Frontmatter `engine:` (deprecated aliases: `tool:`, `_tool:` — they still
   work but warn).
5. Config `engine:` (project config beats `~/.mdflow/config.yaml`).
6. Built-in default: `pi`.

Resolution never fails for a missing engine — the default always applies. A
file with no frontmatter and no explicit engine is a document, not a flow:
`md README.md` prints it instead of executing it.

Bundled engine adapters: `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`*, `droid`,
`opencode`, `pi` (default), `cursor-agent`, `agy` (Google Antigravity).

\* Google sunset the gemini CLI for individual accounts in June 2026; the
gemini adapter remains only for Gemini Code Assist Standard/Enterprise orgs.
Use `agy` otherwise.

## Frontmatter contract

### Core behavior

- All non-system frontmatter keys are forwarded as CLI flags.
- Values map as:
  - `key: "value"` -> `--key value`
  - `key: true` -> `--key`
  - `key: false` -> omitted
  - `key: [a, b]` -> `--key a --key b`

### System keys

| Key | Type | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | Flow metadata: human/roster-facing summary; never passed as a CLI flag. |
| `route` | Reserved for keyword routing; never passed as a CLI flag. |
| `engine` | string | Names the engine that runs the flow (deprecated aliases: `tool`, `_tool`). |
| `_inputs` | `string[]` or typed object | Declares template variables and prompt UI. |
| `_env` | `Record<string, string \| number \| boolean>` | Sets environment variables for command execution. Values are coerced to strings. |
| `_interactive`, `_i` | boolean-ish | Enables interactive mode transforms. |
| `_cwd` | string | Overrides execution working directory for inlines/commands. |
| `_subcommand` | string or string[] | Prepends subcommand tokens to generated args. |
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | string | Maps positional prompt body to named flag(s). |
| `context_window` | number | Overrides context token-window estimation. |
| `_mdflow_version` | string | mdflow version the flow was created with. Stamped automatically by `md create`/`md init`; never a CLI flag. |
| `_compat` | string | Newest mdflow version verified to run the flow successfully. Stamped/upgraded automatically after clean local runs; never a CLI flag. |
| `_flow_id` | string | Stable identity used by feedback and proposal receipts across rename/clone; stamped by `md create`/`md init`, never passed as a CLI flag. |
| `evolve` | string or policy object | Proposal-first evolution policy. Valid modes: `off`, `observe`, `suggest`, `propose`, `apply`; legacy `auto` maps to `propose`. Never passed as a CLI flag. |

### Compatibility stamps

Flows track which mdflow they work with, fully automatically:

- `md create` and `md init` stamp `_mdflow_version` at creation time.
- After any successful local run, mdflow records the running version in
  `_compat` (added if missing; upgraded when the recorded version is behind
  on major or minor — patch/prerelease skew never rewrites files). Remote
  flows and eval workspaces are never stamped; failed stamps never affect
  the run.
- On a major-version mismatch between the recorded version and the running
  mdflow, a dim one-line notice is printed to stderr; execution is never
  blocked, and the next clean run re-verifies the flow.
- A file whose frontmatter contains only these stamps still counts as a
  document for the document-vs-flow decision.

### `_inputs` typed object format

Each `_inputs` key must start with `_`, and each value must be one of:

- `text`: optional `default` (string)
- `select`: required `options` (non-empty string array), optional `default`
- `number`: optional `default`, `min`, `max`
- `confirm`: optional `default` (boolean)
- `password`: optional `default` (string)

## Configuration files and precedence

Configuration merge order (lowest -> highest precedence):

1. Built-in command defaults.
2. Global config: `~/.mdflow/config.yaml`.
3. Project config at git root:
   - `mdflow.config.yaml`
   - `.mdflow.yaml`
   - `.mdflow.json`
4. Project config at current working directory (same file names).
5. Agent frontmatter.
6. CLI passthrough flags.

Within a single directory, lookup order is:

1. `mdflow.config.yaml`
2. `.mdflow.yaml`
3. `.mdflow.json`

## URL import policy API

URL imports (`@https://...`) support only `http://` and `https://`.

Policy environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MDFLOW_IMPORT_URL_ALLOWLIST` | Allowlist rules (comma/newline-separated). |
| `MDFLOW_IMPORT_URL_BLOCKLIST` | Blocklist rules (comma/newline-separated). |
| `MDFLOW_URL_ALLOWLIST` | Legacy alias for allowlist. |
| `MDFLOW_URL_BLOCKLIST` | Legacy alias for blocklist. |

Rule formats:

- Hostname: `example.com`
- Host+port: `example.com:8443`
- Wildcard domain: `*.example.com`
- URL prefix: `https://example.com/v1/`
- Match-all: `*`

Blocklist is evaluated before allowlist.

## Timeout environment variables

| Variable | Default (ms) | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MDFLOW_FETCH_TIMEOUT` | `10000` | HTTP fetch operations. |
| `MDFLOW_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Inline command execution. |
| `MDFLOW_AGENT_TIMEOUT` | `0` | Agent process execution (`0` means disabled). |

## Error codes

Structured failures expose stable error codes, shown as:

```text
