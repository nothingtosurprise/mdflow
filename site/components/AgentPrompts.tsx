const SETUP_PROMPT = `Start my repo's agent roster with mdflow:

1. Run \`npx mdflow init --yes\` in this repo. It scaffolds ./flows (starter flows + README roster) and .mdflow.yaml, spending zero engine turns — it never launches an agent in --yes mode.
2. Tailor the generated flows to THIS repo: the right test command, the right diff scope, our vocabulary. Set .mdflow.yaml's engine to whichever CLI I have (pi, claude, codex, copilot, cursor-agent, agy).
3. Add a colocated eval suite to every tailored production flow. Use 1 to 3 behavioral cases that check invariants, not exact wording.
4. Verify for free: run \`md flows/review.md --_dry-run\` and show me the command plan plus which rung of the engine ladder won. Dry-run must not execute inline command imports.
5. Do NOT do a real run or eval until I say go. A real run costs one engine turn; eval cost is one turn per case.`;

const SKILL_COMMAND = `npx skills add johnlindquist/mdflow`;

const EVALS_PROMPT = `Give every flow in ./flows a colocated eval suite <flow>.eval.ts that exports default an EvalCase[]:

- 1 to 3 cases, each with optional setup(dir) fixtures and a check({ stdout, dir, exitCode }) that returns null on pass or a failure reason.
- Check invariants (files created, numbers, names), never exact wording.
- Before running anything, tell me what \`md eval <flow>.md\` will cost (one engine turn per case) and wait for my go-ahead.

Creed: if a guardrail isn't covered by an eval, it's a wish.`;

const MIGRATE_PROMPT = `Migrate my legacy mdflow v2 files to the current format:

1. Move loose agent .md files into ./flows and add a flows/README.md roster index.
2. Frontmatter \`tool:\` / \`_tool:\` becomes \`engine:\`. The \`--_command\` / \`--tool\` flags become \`--engine\`.
3. Rename *.gemini.md flows to *.agy.md (Google sunset the gemini CLI for individuals; agy is the successor, and --yolo is gone there).
4. Verify each file with \`md explain <file>\` and \`md <file> --_dry-run\` (both free). Make no other changes.`;
