/**
 * Agent guidance files — the "flows are the primary workflow" opt-in.
 *
 * When a user decides flows should be the natural way agents work in their
 * repository, mdflow maintains one marker-delimited block in `AGENTS.md` and
 * `CLAUDE.md` at the project root pointing coding agents at the flow roster.
 *
 * Consent is explicit: EVERY write — creating, extending, or refreshing a
 * stale block — requires the `--agents` opt-in (or the init-time question).
 * A marker already present in the repository is data, not the current
 * user's authorization, so plain `md roster sync` only REPORTS drift.
 * Everything outside the markers is user-owned.
 *
 * The sync is PREFLIGHT-FAIL-CLOSED as one multi-file operation: every
 * target is inspected before the first write, and if ANY target is invalid
 * (bad markers, ambiguous markdown, symlink, non-regular file) nothing is
 * written at all; a write failure stops every remaining write. It is not a
 * journaled transaction — an unexpected commit failure on a later target
 * leaves earlier committed targets in place and is surfaced as an error.
 * Each write re-reads its target immediately before the atomic rename and
 * refuses to clobber bytes that changed since inspection.

## mdflow flows

Agent work in this repository runs through mdflow flows: markdown-defined,
eval-guarded agent jobs in \`flows/\`. When a task matches a flow, hand it off
to that flow instead of improvising the same work ad hoc.

- Start every maintenance task with \`md doctor --json\` (FREE, no execution).
- The flow roster and operator card live in \`flows/README.md\`.
- Run a flow: \`md flows/<name>.md\`. Preview any run for free first:
  \`md flows/<name>.md --_dry-run\`.
- Enumerate flows for machines: \`md roster --json\` (FREE).
- Create a new flow: \`md create "describe what it should do"\` (preview with
  \`--dry-run\`).
- A real flow run, eval run, proposal run, and source mutation each require
  separate consent.
- If you are already executing inside an mdflow flow (the environment
  variable \`MDFLOW_ACTIVE_FLOW\` is set), do the current task directly and
  never invoke another flow without a new, explicit user request — recursive
  handoff multiplies cost without a fresh consent boundary.
