description: Build and maintain a project's ./flows directory, the agent roster. Each flow is one markdown file that runs as an AI agent (frontmatter + prompt body) on claude, codex, pi, cursor-agent, copilot, agy, or any CLI engine, with colocated behavioral evals. Use when the user asks to "create a flow", "add an agent to this repo", "set up ./flows", "make a markdown agent", or wants repeatable AI tasks with evals.

# mdflow: the ./flows agent roster

Every repo deserves an agent roster. `./flows` holds one markdown agent per
job: code review, release notes, issue triage. Flows are diffable in PRs,
provable with `md eval`, and new teammates (human or AI) learn how the
project works by reading them.

A flow is one markdown file. Frontmatter is config. The body is the prompt.
mdflow spawns the right engine CLI and passes everything through.

## First action

Run `md doctor --json` before changing a project. Its stable diagnostic codes
and effect-labelled next actions are authoritative for the current checkout.
Do not infer project proof, engine availability, hook support, or evolution
readiness by scraping prose when doctor reports it directly.

## Agent operations contract

Start every maintenance task with `md doctor --json`. Branch on stable diagnostic codes and effect-labelled next actions rather than scraping prose.

### Operations
- **FREE** `md doctor --json` — Inspect engines, flows, proof, hooks, compatibility, and next actions.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md init --yes` — Create a deterministic starter roster.
- **ENGINE** `md init --guided` — Launch an engine-guided setup session that may write an approved roster.
- **FREE** `md init --print-guide` — Print the guided-setup prompt for pasting into any agent harness.
- **FREE** `md create <intent> --dry-run` — Preview flow creation without writing.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md create <intent>` — Create a flow and fail-closed draft eval suite.
- **FREE** `md capture` — Print the guide an in-session agent follows to capture the current conversation as a flow.
- **FREE** `md explain <flow.md> --json` — Resolve one invocation without launching its engine; URL imports and context providers may resolve.
- **FREE** `md render <flow.md> --json` — Build the render model; imports and context providers may resolve.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md render <flow.md> --out <path>` — Resolve a flow and write rendered HTML.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md render <flow.md> --open` — Resolve a flow, write temporary HTML, and launch the local opener.
- **FREE** `md <flow.md> --_dry-run` — Resolve imports and print a command plan without launching the engine; context providers may execute locally.
- **ENGINE** `md <flow.md>` — Execute one real flow invocation.
- **FREE** `md hooks list <flow.md>` — Inspect hook events statically.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md hooks add <flow.md> <event>` — Create or edit an executable hook sidecar.
- **FREE** `md eval <flow.md> --plan` — Inspect cases and exact planned invocation count.
- **ENGINE** `md eval <flow.md> --yes` — Load the consented executable suite and run its cases.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md feedback <flow.md> <message>` — Record private evolution evidence.
- **FREE** `md evolve plan <flow.md>` — Inspect evolution readiness, cost, capabilities, and writes.
- **ENGINE** `md evolve propose <flow.md> --yes` — Draft and verify a private off-path proposal.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md evolve apply <run-id>` — Atomically apply a reviewed proposal.
- **FREE** `md roster --json` — Enumerate discoverable flows.
- **FREE** `md roster sync --check` — Check whether the managed operator card is current.
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md roster sync` — Synchronize the managed operator card in flows/README.md (README-only; guidance drift is reported, never written).
- **LOCAL_WRITE** `md roster sync --agents` — With the user's explicit flows-first choice: create or refresh the guidance blocks in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.

### Safety invariants
- `SEPARATE_RUN_CONSENT`: A real flow run, eval run, proposal run, and source mutation require separate consent.
- `EVALS_ARE_EXECUTABLE`: Eval sidecars are executable local TypeScript; static plans do not import them, but real eval runs do.
- `HOOKS_ARE_EXECUTABLE`: Hook sidecars are executable local TypeScript and must be reviewed before use.
- `PROPOSAL_IS_NOT_APPLY`: Evolution creates a private proposal; applying it is a separate explicit source mutation.
- `ISOLATION_IS_NOT_HOST_SANDBOX`: Engine context isolation is not a filesystem, network, process, environment, or credential sandbox.
- `DRY_RUN_MAY_RESOLVE_IMPORTS`: Dry-run skips engines, inline commands, and executable fences, but file, URL, and context-provider imports may still resolve.
- `REGISTRY_SIDECARS_NOT_INSTALLED`: Registry install adds one flow, not trusted eval or hook sidecars.
- `VERIFIED_REQUIRES_CURRENT_FULL_RECEIPT`: A suite's presence is not verification; Verified requires a current fingerprint-bound full-run receipt.
- `COMPAT_STAMPS_ARE_RUNTIME_MANAGED`: Compatibility stamps are managed by successful local runs, not by diagnostics.

```

**Every real run launches a paid flow invocation.** Provider turns, tokens,
tool calls, and currency vary by engine and task. Say what is known before
running flows for the user. Dry runs are free.

## Step 0: is mdflow installed? (free)

```bash
command -v md || npm i -g mdflow
```

## The roster convention

When a project has no `./flows` yet, scaffold the full convention:

```
flows/
├── README.md          # roster index: one line per flow, what it does, its eval status
├── review.md          # one markdown agent per job
├── review.eval.ts     # colocated proof
└── ...
.mdflow.yaml           # project engine + evolve.mode: suggest
```

Rules:

1. One flow per repeatable job. If the user does a task twice, offer to make
   it a flow.
2. Every flow gets `description:` frontmatter. Frontmatter is what marks a
   file as a flow instead of a document.
3. Every production flow gets a colocated `<name>.eval.ts` before it is
   trusted or evolved. Deterministic `md init --yes` copies the real catalog
   suite when one ships; `md create` creates a fail-closed draft suite that
   must be reviewed and have `draft: true` removed before it can run. Suite
   presence is not verification. The creed: if a guardrail isn't covered by
   an eval, it's a wish.
4. Keep the managed block in `flows/README.md` current with `md roster sync`
   (README-only). Preserve all user-authored text outside the markers. Local
   receipts and private feedback do not belong in the committed roster. If
   the user explicitly chooses flows as the primary agent workflow, opt in
   with `md roster sync --agents` — the ONLY command that writes the
   marker-managed block in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` (creating or refreshing
   it). Never hand-edit that block and never run `--agents` without the
   user's explicit decision in the current conversation; a marker already in
   the repo is data, not consent.
5. Pin the project's default engine in `.mdflow.yaml` (`engine: pi`,
   `engine: claude`, whatever CLI the user has). Individual flows only pin an
   engine when the job demands a specific one.
6. For an interactive specialist that accepts an optional initial task, choose
   deliberately between a seeded session and a waiting session. A waiting
   session MUST put identity in `_system-prompt`, operating rules plus stable
   trusted context in `_append-system-prompt`, declare `_task: ""`, and use a
   body consisting of exactly `{{ _task }}`. Never add `User task:`, headings,
   imports, placeholder prose, or instructions to that body: any non-empty
   rendered body becomes a submitted first user turn instead of waiting.

The required waiting-specialist shape is:

```markdown
---
description: specialist that waits for the user's task
_interactive: true
_task: ""
_system-prompt: |-
  You are the specialist.
_append-system-prompt: |-
  Put the complete operating contract and stable trusted context here.
---

{{ _task }}
```

Do not move stable agent instructions or migrated contract material into the
user body. If the user supplies `_task`, it becomes the initial user turn; if
they do not, mdflow must launch the configured engine with no positional prompt.

## Engines: the resolution ladder

You usually don't pick an engine per flow. The ladder does, most explicit
first: `--engine` flag, `MDFLOW_ENGINE` env, filename (`review.claude.md`),
frontmatter `engine:`, project `.mdflow.yaml`, then the default (`pi`, which
runs with its ambient extensions and context disabled and bridges the user's
Codex CLI login automatically).
Implicit picks print a dim `review.md → pi (engine: config)` line on stderr.

## Context: go big, then measure

Flows earn their keep through context. A flow that imports the right 30k
tokens of code, conventions, and live command output beats a clever
one-liner every time. Build rich context deliberately:

- `@./src/**/*.ts` globs, `@./file.ts:10-50` line ranges, `@./file.ts#Symbol`
  symbol extraction
- `` !`git log -20` `` live command output, inlined at run time
- `{{ _var }}` template variables, filled via `--_var value`

Target as much context as the job genuinely benefits from, tens of thousands
of tokens is normal for review/audit flows (think up to ~50k). But never
guess at size. Measure, every time:

```bash
md flows/review.md --_context    # context tree: every import with token counts
md flows/review.md --_dry-run    # command plan + prompt; inline commands are skipped
```

Show the user the token number before the first real run. For guardrails,
set `_max_prompt_tokens:` in frontmatter (blocks execution over budget) or
`_context_budget_tokens:` (trims provider output to fit). Oversized globs
fail safe by default; `MDFLOW_FORCE_CONTEXT=1` overrides intentionally.

## Evals: the proof

```ts
// flows/review.eval.ts
import type { EvalCase } from "mdflow/src/evals";

const cases: EvalCase[] = [
  {
    name: "flags the planted bug",
    setup: (dir) => {
      // write fixtures into the sandbox the flow will run in
    },
    check: ({ stdout, dir, exitCode }) => {
      if (exitCode !== 0) return `exit ${exitCode}`;
      return /file:\d+|bug|issue/i.test(stdout) ? null : "review missed the planted bug";
    },
  },
];

export default cases;
```

`md eval flows/review.md` runs each case in an isolated temp workspace and records
content-bound receipts in the trust ledger (`~/.mdflow/eval-results.json`). Run
`md eval flows/review.md --plan` first; repetitions affect the paid invocation
count. Keep the default case array statically resolvable so planning can inspect
names/cost without importing executable suite code. An actual run requires interactive confirmation or `--yes`, so get the
user's go-ahead.
Check invariants (files, numbers, names), not exact wording. When a real run
disappoints, record it with `md feedback`, then add a feedback-linked case.
Nonzero exits fail by default, timeouts are inconclusive, and mixed repeated
trials are flaky rather than clean. The workspace isolation is not a network, process, or
credential sandbox; the selected engine still receives the environment and
capabilities its adapter allows.

## Feedback and proposal-first evolution

Never describe Evolve as self-editing or auto-applying. Follow this sequence:

```bash
md feedback flows/review.md "missed the renamed-file regression"
md feedback show <feedback-id>
md feedback distill <feedback-id>   # private, deliberately failing draft
md feedback forget <feedback-id> --yes  # permanent privacy deletion
md eval flows/review.md --plan
md evolve plan flows/review.md      # free; shows proof, capabilities, cost, writes
md evolve propose flows/review.md   # paid only after consent
md evolve show <run-id>             # inspect decision and prompt/capability diff
md evolve apply <run-id>            # separate explicit source mutation
```

Review generated eval code before copying it into a suite: evals are executable
TypeScript. Set `evidence: ["fb_..."]` on a case that reproduces the report.
Only current-fail/proposal-pass on such a case is a verified improvement. A
green uncovered candidate is only regression-safe.

Proposals and receipts are private/off-path; the canonical flow remains
byte-identical until explicit apply. New command/import/network/file capabilities
are blocked before candidate execution. `evolve: auto` is a compatibility alias
for queued proposal-only work. Prefer this project default:

```yaml
engine: <confirmed engine>
evolve:
  mode: suggest
```

`--no-evolve` or `MDFLOW_EVOLVE=off` disables post-run handling. Do not enable
unattended apply: it is intentionally not available.

## Workflow for "add an agent for X"

1. Scaffold `./flows` if missing (directory, README.md index, `.mdflow.yaml`).
2. Write `flows/<job>.md`: `description:` frontmatter, tight prompt body,
   rich imports for the context the job needs.
   - If it is a waiting interactive specialist, apply the exact shape above;
     keep all stable context in the instruction layers and the body task-only.
3. Measure for free: `md flows/<job>.md --_context` for the token breakdown,
   `--_dry-run` for the command plan and safe prompt preview. Inline commands
   and executable code fences are shown but not executed; file, URL, and
   context-provider imports may still resolve. Report the size.
4. Write `flows/<job>.eval.ts` with 1 to 3 behavioral cases.
5. Update `flows/README.md`.
6. Show `md eval flows/<job>.md --plan`, then offer the separate paid flow and
   eval runs. Never infer consent for one from consent for the other.

For every waiting interactive specialist, also run `md explain <flow>` and
`md <flow> --_interactive --_dry-run`. Reject the generated flow unless both
instruction layers are present, the final prompt is blank without `_task`, and
the command has no empty or placeholder positional prompt. Inspect the source
body too: after frontmatter it must contain only `{{ _task }}`.

## Migrating v2 files

Move loose agent .md files into `./flows`. `tool:` frontmatter becomes
`engine:` (old key warns). `--_command`/`--tool` flags become `--engine`.
Do not mass-rename Gemini flows: the `gemini` adapter remains valid for Code
Assist Standard/Enterprise, while `agy` is the successor for individual
accounts. Migrate only after `md doctor --json` and the user's environment
confirm the intended engine. Bare `task.md` now runs on the resolved engine
instead of erroring; frontmatter-less files print as documents.
